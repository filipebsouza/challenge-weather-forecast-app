# Weather app üå§Ô∏èüåßÔ∏è:

## Problem description (as a User Stories):

- As a User, I would like to search some addresses to find the next seven days' weather forecast.
- As a User, I would like to use my current location to find the next seven days' weather forecast.

## Implementation:

- The problem was solved by an Angular app to offer a SPA to communicate with Backend services.
- Location and Weather services are provided by third-party services. Because of that, I decided to make Backend services to create an **Anti-Corruption layer** between Frontend consumption and vendor service.
- The components are divided into Frontend app, Backend Location Web API, and Backend Weather Web API.
- The components are running in Docker containers.
- Integration tests were made for validating communication between third-party services.

## Benefits:

- Weak coupling between Frontend and third-party services.
- Strong Backend Location and Weather contract provide options to replace third-party services if it's necessary.
- The containerization provides an opportunity to deploy in the cloud soon.
- Integration tests increase the confidence in the Backend services.

## Trade-offs:

- Decoupling Backend services decrease the velocity of evolute these solutions because the complexity has increased.
- Integration tests require more effort to maintain and evolve.

## Future implementations:

- Creating unit tests in the Frontend app. This is important in the service layer because this moment doesn't have complex UI behavior to validate.
- Improve Frontend UI to create a better user experience.
- To create a resiliency mechanism to avoid requesting something for down services (for instance: Circuit Breaker).
- To create a self-recovery mechanism for each service.
